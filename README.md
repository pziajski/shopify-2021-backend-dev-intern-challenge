# Backend Developer Shopify 2021 Internship Challenge

The challenge is to build an image repository using any technology.

## Installation

Install dependancies for both the client and server by `cd`'ing into both folder and running `yarn install`.

## Running

Both client and server need to be run seperately, and in different terminal instances.

Starting the client and server are done the same way, by `cd`'ing into the folder matching and running `yarn start`.
